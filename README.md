# Recommendation-Systems-Graphlab-tetsting
This project is mainly done to have a deeper understanding of Recommender systems and to test the awesome cython package 'Graphlab', known for multi-thread parallel processing.

The Movielens dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.

Two types of models were run and compared.
<li>Item similarity model</li>
<li>Popularity model</li><br>

This code was run during initial months of learning. Unfortunately, Graphlab is not supported in Python 3\* and hence not improved/optimized recently.
